            <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This iconic sandwich originated in the Philadelphia area during WWI when Italian immigrants, who worked in a shipyard called Hog Island brought sandwiches of bread, cold cuts, and cheese for lunch. The sandwich became known as ‘Hog Island’ which over time morphed into ‘hoggies’, and finally, ‘hoagies’.</p>
    <p>In 1992, the hoagie was declared to be the ‘official’ sandwich of Philadelphia. With good reason, I might add. A classic Philly-style Italian hoagie is made of crusty, Italian bread that is drizzled with an oil and vinegar dressing and layered with Italian meats and cheeses, then topped with fresh lettuce and tomatoes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple cider vinegar and red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Olive oil – I used garlic-infused olive oil for a subtle garlic flavor that won’t compete with the flavors in the meats.</li>
        <li>Salt, sugar, and black pepper</li>
        <li>Dried basil, dried oregano, and mustard seeds</li>
        <li>Carrots – peel the carrot and chop it finely</li>
        <li>Celery – slice the celery as thinly as possible.</li>
        <li>Banana peppers or swap in what you have on hand. </li>
        <li>Italian hoagie rolls – this is where you should be fussy. Look for a crusty outside, with a fluffy and tender interior. </li>
        <li>Deli meats – use good quality Italian deli meats like capicola, salami, prosciutto, or Mortadella</li>
        <li>Italian cheese – I used sharp, non-smoked provolone. Use good quality cheese.</li>
        <li>Fresh tomatoes and lettuce</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>Make the hoagie spread by bringing the vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and mustard seeds to a boil before pouring the liquid over the chopped vegetables and allowing the vegetables to pickle.</li>
        <li>Make the hoagie dressing by shaking together the olive oil, vinegar, dried herbs, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Make the sandwiches by drizzling the bread with the dressing, layering the meats and cheese on top, spreading the hoagie spread over the last layer of meat, and topped with lettuce and tomato. Drizzle a little more dressing on top of the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Top the sandwich with the top of the hoagie roll and slice it in half.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. (Or wrap in paper and refrigerate up to 12 hours)</li>
